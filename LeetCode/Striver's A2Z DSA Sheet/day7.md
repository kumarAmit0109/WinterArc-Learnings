## Approach 1: Use a Third Array

### Idea:

This approach uses an extra array to merge the two input arrays. We use two pointers, one for each array, and compare their elements. The smaller element is added to the new array, and the corresponding pointer is moved forward. Once one of the arrays is fully traversed, the remaining elements of the other array are copied into the third array. Finally, the merged elements are copied back into the original arrays.

### Steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` for array `a[]` and `right` for array `b[]`.
2. Create a third array, `arr3[]`, of size `a.size() + b.size()`.
3. Compare elements pointed by `left` and `right`. Insert the smaller element into `arr3[]`.
4. Continue this process until one of the arrays is fully traversed, then copy the remaining elements.
5. Copy the elements back from `arr3[]` into `a[]` and `b[]`.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)`  
  Merging two arrays takes linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n + m)`  
  A new array `arr3[]` is created to hold the merged result.

### Code

```cpp
void mergeTwoSortedArraysWithoutExtraSpace(vector<long long> &a, vector<long long> &b) {
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    vector<long long> arr3(a.size() + b.size());
    int index = 0;

    // Merge both arrays into arr3
    while (left < a.size() && right < b.size()) {
        if (a[left] < b[right]) {
            arr3[index++] = a[left++];
        } else {
            arr3[index++] = b[right++];
        }
    }

    // Add remaining elements of a[]
    while (left < a.size()) {
        arr3[index++] = a[left++];
    }

    // Add remaining elements of b[]
    while (right < b.size()) {
        arr3[index++] = b[right++];
    }

    // Copy merged elements back into a[] and b[]
    for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
        a[i] = arr3[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); i++) {
        b[i] = arr3[i + a.size()];
    }
}
```

## Approach 2: Two-Pointer Swap and Sort

### Idea:

This approach uses two pointers, one pointing at the last element of the first array `a[]` and the other at the first element of the second array `b[]`. The idea is to swap elements if they are out of orderâ€”i.e., if an element in `a[]` is larger than one in `b[]`. After the swapping process, both arrays will be individually sorted. Finally, we sort both arrays to achieve the final merged, sorted form without extra space.

### Steps:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - `left` points to the last valid element of `a[]` (i.e., index `a.size()-1`).
   - `right` points to the first element of `b[]` (i.e., index `0`).
2. While moving the pointers:
   - If `a[left] > b[right]`, swap the elements and move the pointers.
   - If `a[left] <= b[right]`, the elements are in correct order, so stop.
3. Sort both `a[]` and `b[]` individually to maintain the order.
4. No extra array is used, and the result will be the merged arrays with all elements in sorted order.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n \log n + m \log m)`  
  Sorting both arrays dominates the time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`  
  The solution modifies the input arrays in-place, without extra space.

### Code

```cpp
void mergeTwoSortedArraysWithoutExtraSpace(vector<long long> &a, vector<long long> &b) {
    int left = a.size() - 1, right = 0;

    // Swap elements if out of order
    while (left >= 0 && right < b.size()) {
        if (a[left] > b[right]) {
            swap(a[left], b[right]);
        }
        left--;
        right++;
    }

    // Sort both arrays individually
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    sort(b.begin(), b.end());
}
```

## Approach 3: Gap Method (Shell Sort Inspired)

### Idea:

This approach uses the gap method, inspired by Shell Sort. We treat both arrays as a single combined array and repeatedly compare elements that are at a gap distance apart. If they are out of order, we swap them. The gap is initially set to `(n + m) / 2`, and with each iteration, the gap is halved until it becomes zero. This method efficiently reduces the number of comparisons and swaps needed to merge the two arrays in-place.

### Steps:

1. Set the initial gap as `ceil((n + m) / 2)`, where `n` is the size of `a[]` and `m` is the size of `b[]`.
2. Use two pointers: `left` starts at 0, and `right` starts at `left + gap`.
3. Compare the elements at positions `left` and `right`. If they are out of order (i.e., `a[left] > a[right]` or `a[left] > b[right - n]` or `b[left - n] > b[right - n]`), swap them.
4. After finishing one pass with the current gap, reduce the gap to `ceil(gap / 2)` and repeat.
5. Stop when the gap becomes 0.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O((n + m) \log(n + m))`  
  Each pass reduces the gap by half, similar to Shell Sort, making the time complexity logarithmic.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`  
  No extra space is used as the merging happens in place.

### Code

```cpp
void mergeTwoSortedArraysWithoutExtraSpace(vector<long long> &a, vector<long long> &b) {
    int n = a.size(), m = b.size();
    int gap = ceil((double)(n + m) / 2);

    while (gap > 0) {
        int left = 0, right = gap;

        while (right < (n + m)) {
            if (right < n && a[left] > a[right]) {
                // Compare and swap within array a
                swap(a[left], a[right]);
            } else if (left < n && right >= n && a[left] > b[right - n]) {
                // Compare and swap between arrays a and b
                swap(a[left], b[right - n]);
            } else if (left >= n && b[left - n] > b[right - n]) {
                // Compare and swap within array b
                swap(b[left - n], b[right - n]);
            }

            left++;
            right++;
        }

        // Reduce the gap for the next pass
        if (gap == 1) {
            break;
        }
        gap = ceil((double)gap / 2);
    }
}
```
