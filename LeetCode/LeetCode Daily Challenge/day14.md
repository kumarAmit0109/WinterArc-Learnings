# Problem: Maximal Score After Applying K Operations

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-score-after-applying-k-operations)

## Approach

1. **Max Heap Initialization**:

   - Use a max heap (priority queue) to store the elements from the input array. This allows us to efficiently retrieve the maximum element.

2. **Performing Operations**:

   - For `k` operations, repeatedly extract the largest element from the heap.
   - Add the largest element to the total score.
   - Update the extracted element by applying the operation and push the new value back into the heap.

3. **Result**:
   - After completing `k` operations, return the accumulated total score.

### Why This Works

The approach is optimal because it always selects the greatest element available in the array for each operation. By consistently using the maximum, we maximize the score, ensuring that we get the best possible outcome after applying all operations.

### C++ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxKelements(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Create a max heap (priority queue) from the input array.
        priority_queue<long long> maxHeap(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        long long totalScore = 0; // Variable to accumulate the total score.

        // Perform k operations.
        while (k--) {
            // Extract the largest element from the heap.
            long long largestElement = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();

            // Add the largest element to the total score.
            totalScore += largestElement;

            // Calculate the new value after applying the operation and push it back into the heap.
            long long updatedValue = (largestElement + 2) / 3; // Correctly applying the operation.
            maxHeap.push(updatedValue);
        }

        return totalScore; // Return the final accumulated score.
    }
};
```
